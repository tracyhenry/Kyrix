This example app is a variant of the [USMap application]() with two coordinated views placed side by side. The view on the left shows state-level US crime rates, where darker colors indicate higher crime rates per 100,000 population. The user can click on a state, and populate the view on the right with a detailed county-level crime rate map centered at the clicked state. On the county canvas, the user can pan around. 

In the [embedding API documentation](https://github.com/tracyhenry/Kyrix/wiki/Web-Embedding), we offer an example to embed this Kyrix app into a web app where more controls and a minimap are available. 

# Installation Instructions for the Impatient
After running `sudo ./run-kyrix.sh --nba`, open another terminal tab and run the following commands:
```
wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/youvfap909mk1m3/usmap_db_psql.sql     # download data
sudo ./docker-scripts/load-sql.sh usmap_db_psql.sql --dbname usmap   # load data into the database, must be run in root folder
cp docker-scripts/compile.sh compiler/examples/USMap_cmv/compile.sh  # copy the compile script
cd compiler/examples/USMap_cmv                                       # go to the app directory
chmod +x compile.sh                                                  # make the compile script excutable
sudo ./compile.sh USMap_cmv.js                                       # compile the application
```
Wait for about one minute, then point your browser at `<ip address>:8000` - remember that if you are using a cloud instance you may (probably) need to open your cloud provider's 
firewall for this port. If that sounds scary, you can create an SSH tunnel from your PC (e.g. Mac) using `ssh -N <server ipaddr> -L 8000:<same ipaddr>:8000` to forward your laptop's port 8000 to the server via [SSH tunneling](https://www.tecmint.com/create-ssh-tunneling-port-forwarding-in-linux/). 

note that you'll need to wait for a message saying `Backend server started...` like this:
```
Serving /project
New project definition coming...
There is diff that requires recomputing indexes. Shutting down server and recomputing...
Precomputing...
Done precomputing!
Completed recomputing indexes. Server restarting...
Backend server started...
```
