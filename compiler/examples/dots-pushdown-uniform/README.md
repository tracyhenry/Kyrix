This is an application used to test performance/scalability. 

For dots-pushdown-uniform, the assumption is that the data is distributed evenly/randomly across the canvas.

dots-pushdown-uniform uses advanced, postgres-only javascript "pushdowns" (via plv8) to (dramatically) accelerate the kyrix indexing process.
