# Kyrix - Generalized Interactive Panning/Zooming Interfaces

## Installation

The easiest way to run Kyrix is to use our docker-compose config. Simply install docker and docker-compose (v3 or later, i.e. don't trust pre-installed versions), then from the main directory run `docker-compose up` which will build and startup Kyrix using the supplied docker-compose.yml file, including a Postgres instance. Allow 10+ minutes for fresh installs to startup, depending on your network and CPU. Google Cloud users: we recommend at least 4 vCPU and 6 GB of RAM.

For installation details, see the manual instructions used to create the docker-compose.yml and Dockerfiles.
